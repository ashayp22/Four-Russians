# Four Russians Implementation

I came across the Four Russians algorithm in [Real World Algorithms](https://louridas.github.io/rwa/assignments/four-russians/), and wanted to implement it. This repository contains a python implementation of the algorithm in $O(n^2 / \log(n))$

## Installation

1. Install [Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) to the root directory
2. Run `make`
